# Known issues, gotchas & fixes

## Gotchas / hard constraints

### GOTCHA — SQLite file-locking does NOT work on Azure Files (SMB) — 2026-07-19
- **What happened:** W2 (PLAN-SIMPLIFICATION) swapped `server/storage.js` from
  sql.js-WASM to native **better-sqlite3** writing directly to the mounted
  `/data/resume-studio.sqlite`. Deployed to `portal-compile-jp` (rev `0000014`):
  **reads worked** (catalog served 172 roles) but **every write failed** with
  `SqliteError: database is locked` (`SQLITE_BUSY`) after waiting the full
  `busy_timeout`; `sync-now` → HTTP 500.
- **Root cause:** `/data` is an **Azure Files SMB** share. SQLite's write path
  needs advisory/byte-range locks + a journal file, which the SMB client does not
  honor reliably, so SQLite can never take the RESERVED/EXCLUSIVE lock. Reads
  (SHARED lock) mostly work; writes don't. (WAL is even worse on SMB — needs shared
  memory — which is why it was already avoided.)
- **Why sql.js was immune:** it never used SQLite locking — it loaded the whole
  file into WASM memory and wrote it back with `fs.writeFile` (plain I/O, fine on
  SMB). That opaque-blob model is exactly why it worked on the mount.
- **Recovery:** rolled `-jp` back to image `ac9b309` (sql.js) → writes restored
  (`sync-now` 200, clean `gmail-sync` tally, no lock errors); reverted commit
  `b9fedf2` so `main` matches prod. Prod DB backed up to
  `~/Downloads/resume-studio-BACKUP-2026-07-19-preW2.sqlite`. **No data lost** —
  writes failed loudly, the file was never corrupted.
- **For any future W2:** better-sqlite3 must run against a **local (container)
  path** where locking works and snapshot the file to the mount for durability
  (the sql.js persistence model, native engine) — do NOT open the DB directly on
  the SMB mount. Alternative: move shared data off file-SQLite (the plan's parked
  Postgres Phase-2). Either way, **test the WRITE path on Azure before shipping.**

## Fixed

### BUG-016 — Every radar deadline rendered urgent-coral — FIXED 2026-07-16
- **File:** `editor/src/index.css`
- **Symptom:** "Not stated" and far-future deadlines showed in the same coral as
  urgent ones; `.urgent` only changed font-weight.
- **Fix:** base `.intern-deadline` stays neutral; coral moved onto `.urgent`.

### BUG-017 — Phone (≤560px) radar rows crushed the company column — FIXED 2026-07-16
- **File:** `editor/src/index.css`
- **Symptom:** At 375px, JA company names wrapped one character per line (~80px column),
  the deadline chip wrapped vertically, and a hidden status select left an empty grid cell.
- **Root cause:** FOUR `.intern-row` grid definitions again (BUG-002 pattern): the
  intended ≤560px grid sat EARLIER in the file than two later ≤860px grids (incl. one in
  the "final overrides" section at ~6200), so at equal specificity the tablet grid won on
  phones; a separate `.intern-row-status{display:none}` kept the status area empty.
- **Fix:** dead ≤560px grid + status-hide removed; one phone grid added AFTER the final
  ≤860px block (company spans the row; match/deadline full-width; status+apply bottom row).
  Lesson (again): every `.intern-row` grid must live in ONE ordered cascade — check
  `grep -n 'grid-template-areas' index.css` before adding another.

### BUG-018 — 6× GET /api/tracker + a LaTeX compile on every page load — FIXED 2026-07-16
- **Files:** `editor/src/hooks/useApplicationTracker.js`, `editor/src/App.jsx`,
  `editor/server/index.js`, `editor/vite.config.js`
- **Symptom:** One dashboard load fired 6 tracker GETs (5 hook mounts × StrictMode) and a
  full `POST /api/compile` (tectonic) although the Editor wasn't visible; every
  `/api/internships` request rebuilt + double-stringified the whole catalog; the client
  was one 1.18 MB chunk.
- **Fix:** module-level tracker cache + in-flight dedupe (catalog-hook pattern); compile
  effect gated on `appView === 'editor'`; 60 s in-process catalog memo; Vite
  `manualChunks` (react / firebase / ui). See ADR-0037.

### BUG-012 — Gmail pipeline silently no-ops without OPENROUTER_API_KEY, poisoning the processed list — FIXED 2026-07-16
- **Date:** 2026-07-16 · **Files:** `editor/server/gmail/sync.js`, `classify.js`
- **Symptom:** Prod backfill returned `{scanned:80, actions:0}` in 16s. Every message was
  marked processed, so a later (fixed) sync would have skipped them forever.
- **Root cause:** `classifyMessage` returns null when `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is unset (the
  same env gap as BUG-010 — the Azure app still lacks the key), and sync treated null as
  "not application-related" while still adding the id to `processedMessageIds`.
- **Fix:** sync bails up-front with `{skipped:'no-llm-key'}`; a null verdict no longer
  marks the message processed; backfill ignores the processed list entirely (one-time
  rescan; the queue dedupes by `message:kind`). Verified on prod revision `--0000004`.

### BUG-015 — GSAP SVG tweens froze invisible / clobbered chip position — FIXED 2026-07-16
- **File:** `editor/src/components/DashboardCharts.jsx`
- **Observed:** trend bars stuck at `scaleY(0)`/partial matrices; the peak count chip
  jumped to the chart top. Three distinct causes: (1) `gsap.context()` + `revert()` in the
  effect cleanup froze tweens mid-flight under React re-renders (months memo changes as
  records load, StrictMode double-mounts); (2) tweening a `<g>` that positions itself via
  an SVG `transform="translate(...)"` attribute — GSAP replaces the attribute; (3) rAF is
  throttled/paused in background/embedded tabs, so `fromTo` starts (invisible state
  applied) but never advances.
- **Fix:** plain `fromTo` tweens with cleanup = `kill()` + `gsap.set(clearProps)` (worst
  case = final state, never invisible); never tween attr-positioned SVG nodes; a
  `setTimeout → tween.progress(1)` fail-safe finishes the animation if rAF stalls.
- **Related:** `--intern-*` CSS vars were scoped to `.internship-radar`; the exported
  DetailPanel rendered colorless in other views until they were also declared on
  `.intern-detail`.

### BUG-013 — Re-drained Gmail interview emails duplicated calendar milestones — FIXED 2026-07-16
- **Files:** `editor/src/hooks/useApplicationTracker.js`, `useGmailInbox.js`
- **Observed live:** after a backfill + a loop re-sync, Money Forward and enechain each had
  two identical interview milestones (`addMilestone` appended blindly).
- **Fix:** Gmail milestones carry a deterministic id (`gmail-<messageId>`); `addMilestone`
  skips a duplicate id AND identical kind+date+time+title (covers pre-fix random-id rows).

### BUG-014 — nano re-classification could downgrade a tracker status — FIXED 2026-07-16
- **File:** `editor/src/hooks/useGmailInbox.js`
- **Observed live:** on a backfill re-run, Turing's borderline "Next steps" email
  classified `applied` (previously `interview`) and pulled the record back.
- **Fix:** the drain seeds its per-company rank from the existing record's status, making
  statuses monotonic across drains (saved/applying < applied < interview < rejected).

### BUG-010 — Live company search dead without a Settings key (env fallback broken) — FIXED locally 2026-07-09
- **Date:** 2026-07-09 · **Files:** `editor/server/load-env.js` (new), `editor/server/index.js`
- **Symptom:** Searching a company not in the catalog showed the research panel, but the
  search errored instantly — "Live research needs an OpenRouter API key" — and the
  "Search official sources" button was replaced by the Add-your-key CTA. Perceived as
  "the search button doesn't work for companies that aren't there."
- **Root cause:** The ADR-0016 key fallback (per-user Settings key → `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
  env) was broken in both environments. Local: `npm run dev` never loaded
  `editor/.env.local` into the Node server (Vite only reads it for VITE_* client vars; no
  dotenv anywhere), so the key sitting in that file was ignored. Prod: the Azure container
  app `portal-compile-jp` was created without the `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` env var (verified
  2026-07-09 by keyless POST to `/api/internships/research-company` → job errored
  `OPENROUTER_API_KEY_MISSING`; the same POST with a key completed with real results).
- **Fix (local):** New dependency-free `server/load-env.js` parses `editor/.env.local` +
  `editor/.env` into `process.env` (real env wins; missing files are a no-op), imported as
  the first import of `server/index.js`. Verified in the browser: with no Settings key,
  searching "Airbnb" runs the full 60s research and reports "No currently available
  internship found on official sources."
- **Fix (prod, pending — needs az login):** `az containerapp update -n portal-compile-jp
  -g internship-portal --set-env-vars OPENROUTER_API_KEY=<key>`. Until then prod users
  must save a key in Settings (that path verified working end-to-end against Azure).
- **Note:** A completed research job is cached server-side for 15 min
  (`RESEARCH_CACHE_MS`), so re-clicking "Search official sources" within that window
  returns the same result instantly — intended, but can read as "button does nothing."

### BUG-007 — "Saved (N)" radar filter shows an empty table — FIXED 2026-07-03
- **Date:** 2026-07-03 · **File:** `editor/src/components/InternshipDashboard.jsx`
- **Symptom:** The Saved button could read e.g. "Saved (1)" while the filtered table was
  empty; the status `<select>` also offered Applying/Applied/Interview options that never
  matched anything.
- **Root cause:** (1) `savedCount` counted raw tracker records with `status==='saved'`, but
  the `savedOnly` filter ran over `visibleCatalog`, which had already dropped expired-deadline
  saved roles and retired-id roles — so count > rows. (2) `visibleCatalog` excludes applied-type
  statuses up front, so the applied-type filter options were guaranteed-empty.
- **Fix:** (a) `isVisibleInRadar` now keeps `status==='saved'` roles visible even past their
  deadline (shown with the existing urgent/expired styling). (b) `savedCount` is derived from
  `visibleCatalog` with the same `statusFor(id)==='saved'` predicate the filter uses, so count ≡
  rows. (c) the radar status filter excludes `APPLIED_TYPE_STATUSES`, leaving only Saved.
- **Verified:** build green, E2E 5/5; predicates are identical by construction so count == rows.
  NOTE: a saved role retired from the catalog is excluded from both count and rows (no mismatch);
  a dismissible "saved role no longer listed" notice remains a possible future enhancement.

### BUG-008 — Stale `profile:temp` (nameEn "fdf") KV row lingered — FIXED 2026-07-03
- **Date:** 2026-07-03 · **File:** `editor/server/index.js`
- **Symptom:** The scratch profile `temp` (`server/profiles/temp.json` deleted long ago) still
  had a `profile:temp` KV row locally and in the prod Blob snapshot.
- **Fix:** Added `RETIRED_PROFILE_IDS = ['temp']` + `purgeRetiredProfiles()` (deletes
  `profile:`/`tracker:`/`applications:` keys), run in `initPersistentStore()` on every boot;
  `listProfiles()` also excludes retired ids defensively. Idempotent; rewrites the Blob snapshot
  so prod is cleaned on the next deploy.
- **Verified:** local KV had `profile:temp` before boot, `(none)` after; `/api/profiles` lists
  only `aiko_tanaka` + `mohamed_fuad`.

### BUG-009 — Module-scope clock (`NOW`/`TODAY`) went stale across midnight — FIXED 2026-07-03
- **Date:** 2026-07-03 · **File:** `editor/src/components/InternshipDashboard.jsx`
- **Symptom:** `NOW`/`TODAY` were computed once at module load, so a tab left open across
  midnight JST evaluated deadline expiry/urgency against yesterday.
- **Fix:** Replaced the module constants with per-call helpers `nowDate()` / `todayIso()` used
  at every site (`isExpiredDeadline`, `deadlineClass`, verified-date copy). `ApplicationCalendar.jsx`
  already computed `new Date()` per render — no change needed.
- **Verified:** build green, E2E 5/5.

### BUG-006 — Retired internships survived seed cleanup via persisted catalog — FIXED 2026-07-02
- **Date:** 2026-07-02 · **Files:** `editor/server/index.js`,
  `editor/server/seeds/catalog.js`, `editor/server/seeds/catalog-audit-2026-07-02.js`
- **Symptom:** Removing or filtering a static seed did not remove the old row from the
  running catalog; `readInternshipCatalog()` classified the stored copy as a non-seed row
  and merged it back. A stale Apple live-research row also returned a generic careers shell.
- **Root cause:** Seed membership was the only distinction between current and stored data;
  there was no durable retirement concept shared by seed assembly and persistence merges.
- **Fix:** A dated audit owns exact retired IDs and current record patches. The seed builder
  applies it, while catalog reads, legacy custom merges, and writes all reject retired IDs.
  Restarting the server rewrote SQLite from 185 stale rows to exactly 173 current rows.
- **Verified:** API count 173, no retired IDs, research date 2026-07-02; catalog schema/DB
  passes and all 173 unique official URLs pass liveness. See ADR-0013.

### BUG-005 — "Validate Catalog" CI flaky-fails on Nuro `UND_ERR_SOCKET` — FIXED 2026-06-30
- **Date:** 2026-06-30 · **Files:** `editor/server/validate-catalog.js`,
  `editor/server/seeds/internships.js`
- **Symptom:** The `Validate Catalog` GitHub Action failed on `main` (eae7ca8). The
  link-liveness step reported exactly **1 broken** URL —
  `https://nuro.ai/careersitem?gh_jid=7594577` (`global-035`, Nuro Data Scientist Intern)
  with `✗ BROKEN UND_ERR_SOCKET` — while everything else passed (183 entries, 0 format
  errors, DB ok, 179/180 links). The same URL passed **180/180 locally**.
- **Root cause:** `UND_ERR_SOCKET` is a transport-level connection reset (undici "other
  side closed"), here triggered by Nuro's anti-bot layer hanging up on GitHub runner IPs —
  **not** a dead posting. Confirmed live via Nuro's Greenhouse board API
  (`boards-api.greenhouse.io/v1/boards/nuro/jobs/7594577` → "Data Scientist Intern", updated
  2026-06-26) and HTTP 200 from `nuro.ai`/`www.nuro.ai`. The old `checkUrl` treated **all**
  pre-HTTP network errors as HARD failures and did no retries, so any single anti-bot/flaky
  reset failed the whole daily run.
- **Fix:** (1) Kept the verified-live URL, bumped `global-035` `verifiedDate`
  2026-06-27→2026-06-30. (2) `checkUrl` now **retries** transport-level errors
  (`VALIDATE_LINK_RETRIES`=2, linear backoff `VALIDATE_LINK_RETRY_BACKOFF_MS`=600ms) with
  fuller browser-like headers (`LIVENESS_HEADERS`: UA + Accept + Sec-Fetch/
  Upgrade-Insecure-Requests). New `classifyNetworkError` downgrades **persistent**
  resets/timeouts (`UND_ERR_SOCKET`, `ECONNRESET`, `ETIMEDOUT`, undici connect/headers/body
  timeouts, "socket hang up"/"other side closed", `EAI_AGAIN`) to a **SOFT warning**; genuine
  dead links stay **HARD** — DNS-not-found (`ENOTFOUND`), non-HTTPS/malformed, dead redirects,
  HTTP 4xx/5xx (HTTP responses are never retried, returned immediately). Exit-code contract
  unchanged (non-zero only on hard failures); soft-print omits a `(0)` status.
- **Verified:** `validate:catalog` 184 entries / 0 errors / DB ok; `validate:catalog:links`
  **181/181 ok · 0 broken** (exit 0); `npm run build` green. Logic unit-checked with mocked
  fetch: `UND_ERR_SOCKET` & "socket hang up" → soft (`hard:false`); `ENOTFOUND` & HTTP 404 →
  hard. See ADR-0011.
- **Note:** If Nuro persistently resets the runner even after retries, it will show as a
  single SOFT `⚠ network reset after 3 tries (UND_ERR_SOCKET)` warning — informational, does
  not fail CI. Tune `VALIDATE_LINK_RETRIES`/`VALIDATE_LINK_RETRY_BACKOFF_MS` if needed.

### BUG-004 — Application calendar shows only "Rakuten Group" — FIXED 2026-06-30
- **Date:** 2026-06-30 · **File:** `editor/src/components/ApplicationCalendar.jsx`
- **Symptom:** The calendar/timeline displayed only the two Rakuten roles, even though
  several other internships were tracked/applied (NVIDIA, ispace, HENNGE, …).
- **Root cause:** `calendarEvents()` only pushed an event when `record.deadlineDate` matched
  `YYYY-MM-DD`. Only the 2 Rakuten roles had an exact deadline; every other record (including
  applied ones) had `deadlineDate: null` ("Not stated"), so they produced no events. Event ids
  are unique (`${id}-deadline`, milestone ids) — there was **no** company-dedupe bug.
- **Fix:** applied-type records `{applying, applied, interview}` without a deadline now emit a
  green "applied" marker on the applied date (`record.updatedAt || createdAt`), in addition to
  all deadline + milestone events. Also hardened `ProfileDashboard.jsx`'s off-catalog record
  fallback so untracking a record not in the loaded catalog resolves `.id`/`.url` correctly.
  See ADR-0010.
- **Verified:** `npm run build` green.

### BUG-003 — Duplicated eligibility bullets + untranslated JA strings — FIXED 2026-06-30
- **Date:** 2026-06-30 · **Files:** `editor/src/utils/internshipDisplay.js`,
  `editor/server/seeds/internships.js`
- **Symptom:** The DetailPanel eligibility list repeated the same bullet (esp. in JA, where
  several distinct EN lines mapped to one generic JA fallback); many entries still showed
  English in JA mode (bare `English`/`Japanese`, untranslated roles/tracks/dates/places);
  `global-081` (Geotab) had garbled scraped role/compensation text.
- **Root cause:** Eligibility was merged/derived at render time without de-duplication; the
  JA `displayValue/displayRole/jaDisplay` maps were missing many terms; scrape artifacts in
  one seed entry.
- **Fix:** `internshipDetails()` now de-dupes `eligibility`/`eligibilityJa` (case-insensitive,
  trimmed) — 31 entries collapsed, 0 dups remain. Added the missing JA mappings (languages,
  ~30 role/section terms + fallbacks, month/date phrases, 19 `TRACK_LABELS_JA`, JP places).
  Cleaned `global-081` role/compensation/fitNote. Verified: `validate:catalog` 0 errors, build
  green. See ADR-0009.
- **Note:** The non-displayed `workAuth` field still contains scraped question text on a few
  US entries (1174/1244/2119/2154) — harmless (not rendered), left as-is.

### BUG-002 — Internship Radar table forces a horizontal scrollbar — FIXED 2026-06-30
- **Date:** 2026-06-30 · **File:** `editor/src/index.css`
- **Symptom:** The radar results table overflowed the viewport and showed an unwanted
  horizontal scrollbar; some `<select>`s (esp. the per-row status select) had a large gap
  between the label and the dropdown chevron.
- **Root cause:** Four drifted `.intern-table-head,.intern-row` `grid-template-columns`
  definitions existed; the *winning* late block set `min-width: 1180px` together with
  `.intern-results { overflow-x: auto }`, forcing overflow. Status selects used
  `width:100%` (native select right-aligns the chevron → big middle gap).
- **Fix:** Collapsed to one shrink-safe fluid grid (`minmax(0,…)`/`fr`, `column-gap:12px`),
  removed `min-width`/`overflow-x`, added `min-width:0` to grid ancestors, dropped dead
  1450/1250px overrides; normalized all selects with a shared `appearance:none` + custom
  chevron rule and content-sized width for status selects. See ADR-0008.
- **Verified:** `npm run build` green; headless Chromium shows
  `scrollWidth - clientWidth === 0` at 1024/1280/1440 + mobile widths.

### BUG-001 — Track filter returns no results in Japanese mode
- **Date:** 2026-06-29 · **File:** `editor/src/components/InternshipDashboard.jsx`
- **Symptom:** In JA (`?lang`/JA toggle), choosing any value in the **Track** filter
  emptied the internship table ("No internships match these filters").
- **Root cause:** The track `<select>` options had no explicit `value`, so the option
  value defaulted to its rendered text. In JA, `trackLabel(option, true)` returns a
  Japanese label, so `setTrack` stored the Japanese string while catalog items keep
  English `item.track` → `item.track === track` was always false. The sibling
  `region` filter had already been given `value={option}` in the in-progress work;
  `track` was missed.
- **Fix:** Added `value={option}` to the track options so the stored value is always
  the raw (English) track regardless of display language.
- **Verified:** `npm run build` passes; no lint errors; logic now mirrors the working
  `region`/`language`/`status` selects (which all carry explicit values).

### ISSUE-002 — Duplicated JA translation logic (drift risk) — RESOLVED 2026-06-29
`components/InternshipDashboard.jsx` used to define a near-identical local `jaDisplay` /
`displayValue` / `displayRole` alongside the exports in `utils/internshipDisplay.js`,
and they had drifted. **Unified** into the single `utils/internshipDisplay.js` module:
the comprehensive radar chain now lives there (as `jaDisplay` + exported `displayValue`/
`displayRole`); the dashboard imports them and the inline copies were deleted. All three
consumers (`ProfileDashboard`, `InternshipDashboard`, `ApplicationCalendar`) now share
one source. New phrases go in **one** place. (Folding in the superset also fixed a latent
typo where `Class of 2028 Security Engineer Internship` rendered as ソフトウェア… in the
util copy.) See `agent/decisions.md` ADR-0006.

### ISSUE-003 — `displayValue` partial translation for `Not stated; …` — RESOLVED 2026-06-29
The generic `.replace(/Not stated;\s*/gi,'記載なし・')` ran before the specific
`^Not stated; PC and transport benefits listed$` rule, leaving it dead and rendering the
string half-translated. **Fixed** by hoisting the specific full-string rule above the
generic prefix replace in the unified `jaDisplay` chain
(`displayValue('Not stated; PC and transport benefits listed', true)` →
`記載なし・PC/交通費支給あり`).

### ISSUE-004 — Playwright spec drift vs. current UI — RESOLVED 2026-06-29
The old `editor/tests/e2e/editor.spec.ts` (~59 cases) targeted an idealized form-first
UI (`input[name="fullName"]`, a `/api/resume` → `personalInfo` contract) that the
dashboard-first app never shipped. A full run (browser installed) confirmed **57 failed
on drift, 2 passed** (both language-toggle checks against the real shell). The stale file
was deleted and replaced with `editor/tests/e2e/app-smoke.spec.ts` (4 cases, all green)
covering the real shell: language switcher, rapid toggle stability, and dashboard ↔ radar
↔ editor navigation. Build remains the primary client gate. See ADR-0007 and `tests.md`.

## Known / open (non-blocking)
- None currently tracked. (ISSUE-002/003/004 resolved 2026-06-29 — see above.)

## Environment gotchas
- **`server/load-env.js` was imported but never committed (fixed 2026-07-15, `afe495a`):**
  `server/index.js` line 1 imports `./load-env.js`, but the file only ever existed on one
  machine — every fresh clone failed to boot with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`. Recreated as a
  dependency-free `.env.local`/`.env` loader and committed. Lesson: `git status` before ending
  a session; an import you add is a file you must commit.
- **Stale Vite HMR errors in the browser console:** after fixing a JSX syntax error, the
  in-app browser's console buffer still shows the old `[hmr] Failed to reload` lines across
  reloads. Verify against the Vite *server* log (or a screenshot of the rendered app), not the
  console buffer, before concluding the build is broken.
- **Tectonic required:** `/api/compile`, `/api/export/pdf`, and `build_all.sh` need the
  `tectonic` binary (`TECTONIC_PATH`). Without it, compile falls back to the last saved
  PDF and the LaTeX tests fail.
- **Prod durability:** Without `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`, Vercel writes are ephemeral.
- **Research jobs are in-memory:** `/api/internships/research-company/:jobId` returns
  404 after a server restart. **Corollary — the compile/research host must run a single
  replica:** the job Map is per-process, so the start-POST and poll-GETs must hit the same
  instance. Azure Container Apps was first created with `--max-replicas 2`; on scale-up the
  ingress round-robined polls onto a replica with no job → 404 → UI "search failed". Fixed
  by pinning `--min-replicas 1 --max-replicas 1` (2026-07-06, ADR-0019).
- **gpt-5-mini live search is slow (120–245 s):** the `:online` web search regularly
  exceeds a 200 s LLM timeout on the slow tail → job errors as "search failed". Default
  `INTERNSHIP_RESEARCH_TIMEOUT_MS` raised to 280000; the client polls indefinitely so the
  long wait itself is fine (staged "thinking → searching → compiling" progress covers it).
- **Large research+edit worker tasks can hit `resource_exhausted`:** the internship apply-link
  audit overran an agent's context twice when research-subagent fan-out + seed edits +
  validation were combined in one worker. Mitigation: ship the already-complete sub-fixes
  first, then run the link audit as a small pre-scoped worklist (the validator's `[1b]`
  generic-apply-url list) in a fresh lean worker, and have research subagents return only
  compact `id → url` verdicts (never page dumps).
- **BUG-011 — a Vercel Blob outage 500s every `/api/*` route (fixed 2026-07-15):** the free
  tier's 2,000 Advanced-Request quota was exhausted, so Vercel **paused store access for 30
  days** and every Blob read returned `403 Forbidden`. `storage.js` treated Blob as a hard
  dependency: `refreshFromBlob()` runs on EVERY `getJson`, and its throw propagated → 500 on
  `/api/profiles`, `/api/resume`, `/api/tracker`, … → the app hung forever on its `!resume`
  "Loading…" state. Nothing in the UI said why. **Fix:** Blob is now best-effort — read and
  write failures log ONCE (`disableBlob()` latches a `blobDisabled` flag so a paused store
  doesn't retry per request) and fall back to the local SQLite file; writes fall through to
  the local write rather than being lost. Verified: with the paused token, `/api/profiles`
  went 500 → 200.
  **Scope of the outage was narrow, and worth knowing:** per-user data (profiles, résumé,
  tracker, applications) lives in **Firestore** (`users/{uid}/…`), not Blob. The Blob-backed
  SQLite KV holds only the internship catalog — which `readInternshipCatalog()` re-seeds from
  `server/seeds/` when the store is empty — plus `customInternships`. So Blob is a cache with
  one durable payload (`customInternships`), not the system of record.
  **To drop Blob entirely** (no code change needed): unset `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` and point
  `RESUME_STUDIO_DATA_DIR` (already env-configurable, `server/index.js:38`) at a persistent
  mount, e.g. an Azure Files share on the container app. Without a persistent mount the
  container's SQLite is ephemeral and `customInternships` resets on restart (the catalog
  itself re-seeds, so it survives). Local dev: the `resume-studio-localdb` launch config
  passes `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=` (empty) — `load-env.js:29` only fills vars that are
  `undefined`, so an empty value wins over `.env.local`.
